# class-to-classname VS Code Extension

This extension will replace `class=` with `className=` when pasting in to React files (identified by either the .jsx or .tsx extensions, or in unsaved files that have the Javascript React or Typescript React language mode). This makes copying from HTML-based sources (such as Tailwind UI) to React destinations easier.

## Installation

You can install this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dylangarcia.class-to-classname).
